## Analyst Assist Agents

ThreatHunt includes analyst-assist agents that:
- Help interpret imported artifact data
- Suggest analytical pivots and filters
- Highlight anomalies or points of interest
- Assist in forming and testing hypotheses

Agents do not perform analysis independently.
They guide, explain, and assist the analyst.
