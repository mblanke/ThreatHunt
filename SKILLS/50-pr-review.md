# PR Review Skill

Reviewer must check:
- Correctness: does it do what it claims?
- Safety: secrets, injection, auth boundaries
- Maintainability: readability, naming, duplication
- Tests: added/updated appropriately
- DoD: did it pass?

Reviewer output format:
1) Summary
2) Must-fix
3) Nice-to-have
4) Risks
5) Verification suggestions
